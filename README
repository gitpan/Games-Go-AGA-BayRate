Games::Go::AGA::BayRate:
------------------------

The American Go Association (AGA) provides a rating system for the go
players of the nation.  The algorithm is described in detail in a paper
on their web-site (http://usgo.org):  AGARatings-Math.pdf.  They also
provide a C++ implementation example: bayrate.zip.

This module implements a perl version of bayrate, both the executable
and the support objects (Game, Player, etc).  Note: only bayrate is
included here, singlerate and check are left as an excersise for the
student.

bayrate, and this module, require a fairly recent version of GNU Scientific
Library (GSL), including the devel portion (containing header files, etc).
If you are using Fedora (linux), "yum install gsl gsl-devel" should be
sufficient.  Version 1.14 and later should work, earlier versions may
not.  To find your current version, run:

    pkg-config --modversion gsl

Work is being done to provide a full perl interface to GSL, but it is
not complete as of this writing.  I have used Inline::C to hook to the
specific GSL functions used by bayrate.pl.  The missing parts needed by
bayrate.pl are the Multimin functions (f_minimizer and fdf_minimizer).
Tests for the Inline::C interface to these functions (as well as the C
versions as called out in the Gnu GSL documentation) are included in the
'extra' subdirectory of this package.
